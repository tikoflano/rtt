# TODO

Completed tasks:

- [x] Research Angular standalone components and use them if needed
- [x] Replace MySQL with Postgres

**Note:** After merging the PostgreSQL migration, run `python manage.py migrate` against the new PostgreSQL database. Existing MySQL data must be migrated separately if needed.
